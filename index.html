    <h1>Commentary</h1>
    <p>I got this computer two years ago, new, for school. I use it for drawing and writing,
and up until now it hasn't left my desk, so it's weird to see the battery level go down.</p>
    <p>My computer has pretty amazing preformance, but it slows down at around 30 tabs, and
when I'm playing most video games. You'd think with 8 GB of RAM it'd be able to handle
more chrome tabs, but I think my computer isn't great at prioritization.</p>
